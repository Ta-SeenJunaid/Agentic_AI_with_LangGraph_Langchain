Brilliant Bradley & Mac Allister take down MadridGettyPlayer ratingsReal MadridMbappe & Bellingham have rare off-days as Madrid beatenReal Madrid\\'s big guns went missing, and Los Blancos failed to conjure up any Champions League magic in Tuesday\\'s 1-0 loss to Liverpool. Kylian Mbappe and Jude Bellingham, in particular, were kept curiously quiet as Madrid saw their perfect start to their European campaign end in fairly unremarkable circumstances against Arne Slot\\'s struggling Reds.   Getty/GOALPlayer ratingsArsenalWho needs Gyokeres?! Merino makes his mark in UCL cruiseArsenal\\'s 3-0 victory over Slavia Prague on Tuesday made it four wins from four in the Champions League for the high-flying Gunners so far in 2025-26. Bukayo Saka, captain for the night, got the ball rolling from the penalty spot, before Mikel Merino took over as the Spain international, playing in place of Viktor Gyokeres, scored twice in a clinical performance in the Czech capital.GettyChampions LeagueBayern MunichDiaz gets lucky! 10-man Bayern cling on for huge PSG winDefending champions Paris Saint-Germain were beaten 2-1 by 10-man Bayern Munich in the Champions League at Parc des Princes on Tuesday. Luis Diaz scored both goals in an impressive first half but then saw red just before half-time for a reckless challenge on Achraf Hakimi. PSG hit back after the break, pulling one goal back through substitute Joao Neves, but Bayern managed to hang on for all three points.GOALPlayer ratingsTottenhamGive Van de Ven the Puskas! Solo stunner caps Spurs winTottenham boosted their chances of reaching the knockout stages of the Champions League with a commanding 4-0 win at home to Copenhagen, despite playing much of the second half one man light. Goal-scorer Brennan Johnson was sent off with Spurs already two to the good, but Thomas Frank\\'s side showed fantastic character to score twice more as they put in arguably their best performance of his tenure so far.Getty/GOALAnalysisManchester CityCity\\'s \\'free soul\\' Cherki can be a Pep player after allIf there was an air of inevitability about Erling Haaland scoring Manchester City\\'s first two goals against Bournemouth on Sunday, the same could not be said of the man who provided both of the assists. Rayan Cherki was making his first Premier League start in 10 weeks due to injury, but even before he picked up a thigh problem in August, there were many questions about his suitability to playing for Pep Guardiola.GOALHidden Gems FCEtta EyongHidden Gems FC: Why Europe\\'s elite all want Levante\\'s Etta EyongThe list of top goal-scorers through the early weeks of La Liga\\'s season is full of familiar faces.

Mary Earps, who has made plenty of headlines this past week ahead of the release of her book \\'All In\\', is a prime example of as much. Only six months ago, the goalkeeper stood tall as a true England hero, having delivered world-class performances in the Lionesses\\' 2022 European Championship triumph and their run to the 2023 Women\\'s World Cup final.

With so much up and coming talent in world football, Joe breaks down which players you need to keep an eye on in the coming months and just how they are making their mark at such a young age. From an Arsenal youth prospect, to Liverpool's youngest every player, here are the four wonderkids set to define the next generation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow good actually was Romelu Lukaku?\\n\\n\\nRomelu Lukaku: from Anderlecht wonderkid to Premier League star, Inter Milan hero, and Belgium’s greatest-ever goalscorer. This is the story of how Lukaku went from mocked to magnificent — a striker rebuilt through setbacks, goals and redemption. Featuring his time at Chelsea, Manchester United, Inter Milan, Roma, Napoli, and Belgium’s golden generation, Matt explores every chapter of his incredible journey. The power, the pressure, the perception — and the truth behind it all.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow Harry Maguire won a new contract at Man United\\n\\n\\nHarry Maguire has lived through one of the most polarizing careers in modern football. From becoming the world’s most expensive defender at Manchester United to facing relentless mockery, boos, and even his own fans turning on him, Maguire’s story is one of resilience against all odds. And yet, when England needed him most - at the 2018 World Cup, Euro 2020, and beyond - he stood tall, delivering on the biggest stages. A journey from ridicule to redemption, and after his goal v Liverpool, don't say we didn't tell you so. Harry Maguire: Respect the name.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen a footballers career doesn't make sense\\n\\n\\nFor years he was ridiculed, the butt of jokes and conspiracies about money laundering, memed relentlessly for his poor performance. But look closer at the career of Álvaro Morata, you'll find a resilient, determined, top quality striker who has had a career at both international and club level that most players would die for. From trophies to crucial goals, hate to redemption, this is the story of Alvaro Morata. Respect The Name.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDele: The story that football got wrong\\n\\n\\nFrom PFA awards and being England's next golden boy - to years offset by injuries, criticism and personal struggles, rarely have so many highs and lows been packed into such a relatively short career. The undeniable truth, though, is that Dele reached levels of footballing brilliance that shouldn't be forgotten, regardless of where his potential could've taken him. This is 'Respect The Name' episode two: Dele.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs This Liverpool’s Most Disrespected Striker Of All Time\\n\\n\\nRespect The Name is our new FourFourTwo series looking at some of the best players whose careers are often remembered for the wrong reasons. Episode 1, is for Emile Heskey. For years, his name was a punchline, even after building one of the most underrated careers in English football. From breaking through at Leicester, to leading the line for Liverpool’s treble-winning side, to earning over 60 England caps, Heskey’s story is far richer than the highlight reels suggest...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInside Japan’s Football Obsession | J.League x FourFourTwo\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is why Liverpool flew to the other side of the world | J.League x FourFourTwo\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat did the Premier League spend all this money on?\\n\\n\\nWith all the money spent over the course of the summer, PapaPincus is back with us to give his ruling over the best and worst of the 3.1 BILLION pounds spent in the Premier League!
